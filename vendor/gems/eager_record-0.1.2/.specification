description: EagerRecord extends ActiveRecord to automate association preloading. Each time a collection of more than one record is loaded from the database, each record remembers the collection that it is part of; then when one of those records has an association accessed, EagerRecord triggers a preload_associations for all the records in the originating collection. Never worry about that :include option again!

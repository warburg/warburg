# This example demonstrates Document#lazy_bounding_box, which is used for
# storing a set of drawing instructions to be executed later.  This is used
# for header and footer support in Prawn, and can be used for repeating page
# elements in general.
#
# Note that once a lazy bounding box is positioned, it calculates its anchor
# relative to its parent bounding box.  It will be positioned at this exact
# location each time it is redrawn, regardless of the bounds 
# LazyBoundingBox#draw is in.

      <h1>Userstamp Plugin (v 2.0)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Userstamp Plugin extends <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord::Base</a>
to add automatic updating of &#8216;creator&#8217;, &#8216;updater&#8217;,
and &#8216;deleter&#8217; attributes. It is based loosely on the <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Timestamp.html">ActiveRecord::Timestamp</a>
module.
</p>
<p>
Two class methods (<tt>model_stamper</tt> and <tt>stampable</tt>) are
implemented in this plugin. The <tt>model_stamper</tt> method is used in
models that are responsible for creating, updating, or deleting other
objects. The <tt>stampable</tt> method is used in models that are subject
to being created, updated, or deleted by &#8216;stampers&#8217;.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Installation of the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin
script. Issue the following command from the root of your application:
</p>
<pre>
  script/plugin install git://github.com/delynn/userstamp.git
</pre>
<p>
Once installed you will need to restart your application for the plugin to
be loaded into the Rails environment.
</p>
<p>
You might also be interested in using <a
href="http://piston.rubyforge.org/index.html">Piston</a> to manage the
importing and future updating of this plugin.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
In this new version of the Userstamp plug-in, the assumption is that you
have two different categories of objects; those that maniÀùpulate, and
those that are manipulated. For those objects that are being manipulated
there&#8216;s the Stampable module and for the manipulators there&#8216;s
the Stamper module. There&#8216;s also the actual Userstamp module for your
controllers that assists in setting up your environment on a per request
basis.
</p>
<p>
To better understand how all this works, I think an example is in order.
For this example we will assume that a weblog application is comprised of
User and Post objects. The first thing we need to do is create the
migrations for these objects, and the plug-in gives you a
<tt>userstamps</tt> method for very easily doing this:
</p>
<pre>
  class CreateUsers &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :users, :force =&gt; true do |t|
        t.timestamps
        t.userstamps
        t.name
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :users
    end
  end

  class CreatePosts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :posts, :force =&gt; true do |t|
        t.timestamps
        t.userstamps
        t.title
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :posts
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
Second, since Users are going to manipulate other objects in our project,
we&#8216;ll use the <tt>model_stamper</tt> method in our User class:
</p>
<pre>
  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    model_stamper
  end
</pre>
<p>
Finally, we need to setup a controller to set the current user of the
application. It&#8216;s recommended that you do this in your
ApplicationController:
</p>
<pre>
  class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
    include Userstamp
  end
</pre>
<p>
If all you are interested in is making sure all tables that have the proper
columns are stamped by the currently logged in user you can stop right
here. More than likely you want all your associations setup on your stamped
objects, and that&#8216;s where the <tt>stampable</tt> class method comes
in. So in our example we&#8216;ll want to use this method in both our User
and Post classes:
</p>
<pre>
  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    model_stamper
    stampable
  end

  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    stampable
  end
</pre>
<p>
Okay, so what all have we done? The <tt>model_stamper</tt> class method
injects two methods into the User class. They are stamper= and stamper and
look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  def stamper=(object)
    object_stamper = if object.is_a?(ActiveRecord::Base)
      object.send(&quot;#{object.class.primary_key}&quot;.to_sym)
    else
      object
    end

    Thread.current[&quot;#{self.to_s.downcase}_#{self.object_id}_stamper&quot;] = object_stamper
  end

  def stamper
    Thread.current[&quot;#{self.to_s.downcase}_#{self.object_id}_stamper&quot;]
  end
</pre>
<p>
The big change with this new version is that we are now using
Thread.current to save the current stamper so as to avoid conflict with
concurrent requests.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>stampable</tt> method allows you to customize what columns will get
stamped, and also creates the <tt>creator</tt>, <tt>updater</tt>, and
<tt>deleter</tt> associations.
</p>
<p>
The Userstamp module that we included into our ApplicationController uses
the setter method to set which user is currently making the request. By
default the &#8216;set_stampers&#8217; method works perfectly with the <a
href="http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/restful_authentication">RestfulAuthentication</a>
plug-in:
</p>
<pre>
  def set_stampers
    User.stamper = self.current_user
  end
</pre>
<p>
If you aren&#8216;t using ActsAsAuthenticated, then you need to create your
own version of the <tt>set_stampers</tt> method in the controller where
you&#8216;ve included the Userstamp module.
</p>
<p>
Now, let&#8216;s get back to the Stampable module (since it really is the
interesting one). The Stampable module sets up before_* filters that are
responsible for setting those attributes at the appropriate times. It also
creates the belongs_to relationships for you.
</p>
<p>
If you need to customize the columns that are stamped, the
<tt>stampable</tt> method can be completely customized. Here&#8216;s an
quick example:
</p>
<pre>
  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_stampable :stamper_class_name =&gt; :person,
                      :creator_attribute  =&gt; :create_user,
                      :updater_attribute  =&gt; :update_user,
                      :deleter_attribute  =&gt; :delete_user
  end
</pre>
<p>
If you are upgrading your application from the old version of Userstamp,
there is a compatibility mode to have the plug-in use the old
&quot;_by&quot; columns by default. To enable this mode, add the following
line to the RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rb file:
</p>
<pre>
  Ddb::Userstamp.compatibility_mode = true
</pre>
<p>
If you are having a difficult time getting the Userstamp plug-in to work, I
recommend you checkout the sample application that I created. You can find
this application on <a
href="http://github.com/delynn/userstamp_sample">GitHub</a>
</p>
<h2>Uninstall</h2>
<p>
Uninstalling the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin script.
Issue the following command from the root of your application:
</p>
<pre>
  script/plugin remove userstamp
</pre>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
RDoc has been run on the plugin directory and is available in the doc
directory.
</p>
<h2>Running Unit Tests</h2>
<p>
There are extensive unit tests in the &quot;test&quot; directory of the
plugin. These test can be run individually by executing the following
command from the userstamp directory:
</p>
<pre>
 ruby test/compatibility_stamping_test.rb
 ruby test/stamping_test.rb
 ruby test/userstamp_controller_test.rb
</pre>
<h2>Bugs &amp; Feedback</h2>
<p>
Bug reports and feedback are welcome via my delynn+userstamp@gmail.com
email address. I also encouraged everyone to clone the git repository and
make modifications&#8212;I&#8216;ll be more than happy to merge any changes
from other people&#8216;s branches that would be beneficial to the whole
project.
</p>
<h2>Credits and Special Thanks</h2>
<p>
The original idea for this plugin came from the Rails Wiki article entitled

ActiveRecord</a>.
